I received Ph.D. in mining engineering at Virginia Tech with the research efforts focusing primarily on petrophysical property analysis and the geostatistics-based applications of subsurface reservoirs using numerical modeling and laboratory core analysis. I have broad interests in petrophysics, enhanced oil/gas recovery, fluid flow in porous medium, and carbon sequestration. I am currently a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University, where I am working with Prof. Greeshma Gadikota to develop the chemo-mechanical basis for observed failures in engineered and natural materials.
