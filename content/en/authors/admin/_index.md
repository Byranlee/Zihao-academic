I received Ph.D. in mining engineering at Virginia Tech with the research efforts focusing primarily on petrophysical property analysis and the geostatistics-based applications of subsurface reservoirs using numerical modeling and laboratory core analysis. I have broad interests in petrophysics, reactive flow and transport, fluid flow in porous media, and carbon sequestration. I am currently a Post Doctorate RA at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), where I am working to develop the novel proppant, cement, fracturing fluids for the development of subsurface reservoir with high-temperature condition (e.g. geothermal)
