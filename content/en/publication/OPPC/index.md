  The mercury intrusion technique is a crucial in-lab method to investigate the
  porous medium properties. The potentiality of mercury intrusion data has not
  been explored significantly in the traditional interpretation. Thus, a
  hierarchical statistical model that not only captures the quantitative
  relationship between petrophysical properties but also accounts for different
  geological members is developed to interpret mercury intrusion data. This
  multilevel model is established from almost 800 samples with specific
  geological characteristics. We distinguish the fixed effects and the random
  effects in this mixed model. The

  overall connection between the selected petrophysical parameters is described by the

  fixed effects at a higher level, while variations due to different geological members are

  accommodated as the random effects at a lower level. The selected petrophysical parameters are observed through hypothesis testing and model selection. In this case study, five

  petrophysical parameters are selected into the model. Essential visualizations are also provided to assist the interpretations of the probabilistically model. The final model reveals the

  quantitative relationship between permeability and other petrophysical properties in each

  member and the order of relative importance for each property. With this studied relationship and advanced model, the geological reservoir simulation can be greatly detailed and

  accurate in the future.
