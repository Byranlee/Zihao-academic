abstract: A novel multiphysics multiscale multiporosity shale gas transport
  (M3ST) model was developed to investigate shale gas transport in both
  transient and steady states. The microscale model component contains a kerogen
  domain and an inorganic matrix domain, and each domain has its own
  geomechanical and gas transport properties. Permeabilities of various shale
  cores were measured in the laboratory using a pulse decay permeameter (PDP)
  with different pore pressure and confining stress combinations. The
  PDP-measured apparent permeability as a function of pore pressure under two
  effective stresses was fitted using the microscale M3ST model component based
  on nonlinear least squares fitting (NLSF), and the fitted model parameters
  were able to provide accurate model predictions for another effective stress.
  The parameters and petrophysical properties determined in the steady state
  were then used in the transientstate, continuum-scale M3ST model component,
  which performed history matching of the evolutions of the upstream and
  downstream gas pressures. In addition, a double-exponential empirical model
  was developed as a powerful alternative to the M3ST model to fit
  laboratory-measured apparent permeability under various effective stresses and
  pore pressures. The developed M3ST model and the research findings in this
  study provided critical insights into the role of the multiphysics mechanisms,
  including geomechanics, fluid dynamics and transport, and the Klinkenberg
  effect on shale gas transport across different spatial scales in both steady
  and transient states
