abstract: The flow mechanism of gas in organic-rich shale has not been
  investigated well because of the extreme tightness and complicated structure
  of the shale reservoir. Due to the multiple spatial scales, the physical
  properties and upscaling of gas transport in shales have significant
  uncertainties. A novel, modified 2D ternary-porosity model was proposed to
  study multiscale gas transport in shales. The model accounts for kerogen,
  inorganic matter, and granular minerals using physics-based parameters that
  can be measured independently. Each component part has their own permeability,
  porosity, and conductivity. In the kerogen part, gas transport is controlled
  by surface diffusion and adsorption/desorption. In the inorganic matter part,
  the viscous flow of gas is driven by a pressure gradient. In the granular
  minerals part, which consists of quartz, pyrite, and ankerite, etc, the
  porosity of this part is negligible. Therefore, we treated granular minerals
  as impermeable. Besides, the Klinkenberg effect, tortuosity, shale gas
  component, and gas flow direction are also applied for. The certain
  ternary-porosity model was applied to perform history matching of the pulse
  decay permeameter (PDP) experiment in our laboratory. The results demonstrate
  that the overall permeability of the core sample under different confining
  pressures within relatively high effective stress was well-captured by the
  model. The early- or later-time also play essential roles in the permeability
  measurement and cannot be ignored simply
