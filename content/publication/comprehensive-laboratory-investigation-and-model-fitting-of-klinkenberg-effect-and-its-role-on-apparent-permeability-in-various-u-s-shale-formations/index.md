abstract: Hydraulic fracturing in shales is challenging because of the
  complicated stress status. The confining pressure imposed on a shale formation
  has a tremendous impact on the permeability of the rock. The correlation
  between confining pressure and rock permeability is complicated and might be
  nonlinear. Gas flow in low-permeability shales differs significantly from
  liquid flow because of the Klinkenberg effect, especially when the pore
  pressure is relatively low. The Klinkenberg effect results from gas molecule
  slip at the solid walls inside the nanopores, where the collision between gas
  molecules and solid surfaces is more frequent than the collision between gas
  molecules. This effect causes the increase of apparent permeability (i.e., the
  measured permeability). In this study, the simple effective stress law and the
  effective stress coefficient law were used to study the relationship between
  permeability and effective stress. In the simple effective stress law, the
  effective stress is calculated as the difference between confining pressure
  and pore pressure. The Klinkenberg coefficient and the effective mean pore
  radius can then be calculated. In the effective stress coefficient law, there
  is an effective stress coefficient (i.e., the Biot coefficient) which controls
  the influence of pore pressure on the effective stress. In this study, the
  effective stress coefficient was obtained by analyzing a large number of
  laboratory data measured under varying pore pressures and confining pressures.
  Specifically, the permeabilities of core samples extracted from four U.S.
  shale formations were measured using a pulse decay permeameter under varying
  combinations of confining and pore pressures. The samples were cored in the
  directions parallel to and perpendicular to the shale bedding planes, in order
  to test the role of bedding plane direction on the measured permeability.
  Laboratory results demonstrate that the permeabilities of all core samples
  fell in the range between 10-2 millidarcy (mD) and 10-4 mD. In the same
  formation, the permeabilities of the core samples in which the bedding planes
  were in the longitudinal direction were about one order of magnitude higher
  than the permeabilities of the core samples in which the bedding planes were
  in the transverse direction. Using the simple effective stress law, the
  Klinkenberg effect was observed, because the measured apparent permeability
  decreased with increasing pore pressure. Using the effective stress
  coefficient law, the effective stress coefficient was found around 0.5, which
  suggests that the pore pressure had a less influence on the effective stress
  compared to the confining pressure. Moreover, a multiphysical shale transport
  (MPST) model is built that accounts for fluid dynamics, geomechanics, and the
  Klinkenberg effect. The model fitting result is quite matched with PDP
  experimental results. These comprehensive laboratory experiments and model
  fitting demonstrate the role of confining pressure, Klinkenberg effect, and
  bedding plane direction on the gas flow in the nanoscale pore space in shales.
  These experimental data will be valuable in validating and calibrating pore-
  to core-scale numerical models of the flow and transport properties in shale
  formations.
