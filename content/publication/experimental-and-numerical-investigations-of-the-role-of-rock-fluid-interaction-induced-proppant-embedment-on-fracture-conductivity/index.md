abstract: With the improvement of hydraulic fracturing techniques, more
  challenging and longer wells are developed and narrow fracture environments
  are created. The proppant may deposit in the fracture as thin layers and even
  monolayers. Especially when the fracture was exposed to fracturing fluids, the
  softened fracture surface can cause severe proppant embedment, which reduces
  the fracture conductivity significantly. In this study, laboratory experiments
  were first designed to investigate the effect of rock-fluid interaction on the
  proppant embedment and fracture conductivity. The fracture conductivity cell
  experiments were conducted using Berea sandstone and Eagle Ford shale samples,
  which were exposed to fracturing fluids for 1 day and 21 days. A numerical
  modeling approach combining continuum mechanics code, DEM code, and LBM was
  developed to advance the understanding of the fracture conductivity at
  different closure pressures. The continuum mechanics code (e.g., FLAC3D) was
  employed to compute proppant embedment and DEM code (e.g., PFC3D) was used to
  calculate the proppant compaction, rearrangement, and particle crushing. LBM
  simulation was performed on the evolved proppant pack to compute the
  time-dependent permeability of the proppant pack. The simulation results
  demonstrated a strong correlation between proppant embedment and rock
  mechanical properties. When the Young’s modulus of the rock plate is less than
  5 GPa, large magnitudes of proppant embedment can be expected in fractures
  supported by monolayers of ceramic proppant particles. Moreover, large-size
  proppant particles are more sensitive to the variations of Young’s modulus
  change in the rock plate. When the rock formation in a narrow fracture
  environment has a relatively high Young’s modulus, the proppant diameter
  distribution has a lesser effect on the fracture conductivity. The outcome of
  this study will provide insights into the role of reservoir rock
  characteristics, proppant properties, and closure pressure on proppant
  embedment in narrow fractures. The simulated fracture/proppant system can
  demonstrate more realistic interactions between proppants, hydraulic
  fractures, and closure pressures. The proposed numerical workflow provides a
  more efficient and economical way for proppant parameter selections.
