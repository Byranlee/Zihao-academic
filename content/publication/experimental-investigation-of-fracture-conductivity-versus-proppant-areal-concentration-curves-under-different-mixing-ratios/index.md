abstract: In hydraulic fracturing, the transport and deposition patterns of
  proppant particles are crucial for high recovery production of oil and gas
  hydrocarbons. The conductivity of proppant pack depends closely on the
  effective stress, proppant strength, proppant embedment, and proppant areal
  concentration. In this study, a series of laboratory experiments was conducted
  to study the role of effective stress, proppant particle size, and particle
  size heterogeneity on the fracture conductivity versus proppant areal
  concentration curve. In the previous research from our lab, a
  numerical-modeling approach, combining the discrete-element method (DEM) with
  single-/multiphase Lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulation, was introduced to
  advance understanding of the interaction between reservoir depletion, proppant
  particle compaction, and single-/multiphase flows in a proppant-supported
  hydraulic fracture. Our numerical modeling results showed that the
  conductivity curve of a proppant pack having various particle sizes cannot be
  simply obtained based on linear interpolation of the conductivity curves of
  the proppant packs having homogeneous particle sizes. To verify the prediction
  of the DEM-LB model, we collected three types of proppants with mesh-20/40,
  30/50, and 40/70 sizes and then conducted the conductivity testing experiment
  under specific mixing ratios using a fracture conductivity measurement cell.
  The laboratory-measured fracture conductivity versus proppant areal
  concentration curves show an overall good agreement with the modeling
  prediction from the DEM-LB coupled numerical model. It is confirmed that the
  conductivity curve of a proppant pack having various particle sizes cannot be
  simply obtained based on linear interpolation of the conductivity curves of
  the proppant packs having homogeneous particle sizes. This study uses
  laboratory experimental methods to provide insight into the role of effective
  stress, proppant particle size, and particle size heterogeneity on the
  fracture conductivity versus proppant areal concentration curve. The research
  outcome will facilitate the optimization of proppant selection and placement
  in hydraulic fracturing to maximize proppant-supported fracture conductivity
  and to maximize the final recovery factor.
