  A threshold pressure gradient is needed to trigger fluid flow in
  low-permeability porous media, causing a nonlinear relationship between the
  pressure gradient and flow velocity at low-pressure gradient levels (i.e., the
  non-Darcian flow behavior) and thus has important implications in shale oil
  and gas recovery and high-level nuclear waste disposal in geologic
  repositories. Despite the importance of non-Darcian flow in many natural and
  engineering processes, it is still unclear how temperature influences the
  threshold gradient. To answer this fundamental question, a customized core
  flooding system designed for high-precision measurements of hydraulic
  gradients and permeability in swelling bentonite clay was used. The
  measurements were conducted under steady-state flow conditions using a NaCl
  solution having 0.1 M ionic strength and clay/sand mixtures. The temperatures
  range from 20℃ to 90℃ and the mass fractions of clay in the mixtures range
  from 10% to 50%. The correlation curves between Darcy flow velocity and
  pressure gradient were measured to demonstrate the nonlinear behaviors in the
  low-pressure-gradient regimes. Experimental results indicated that a higher
  temperature led to a lower threshold gradient. As the clay mass fraction
  increased, the measured permeability decreased whereas the threshold gradient
  increased. The relationship between permeability and threshold gradient
  followed a power-law empirical correlation, which was consistent with the
  finding in a previous study. The results also showed that higher temperatures
  shifted the correlation curve in the bottom-left direction, and the variations
  of the two fitting coefficients in the power-law correlation were well
  predicted by a continuum-scale two-parameter model proposed in our previous
  study, which provides mechanistic insights into the role of temperature on
  non-Darcian flow in saturated low-permeability porous media. Our experimental
  results validated the proposed continuum-scale model and will have valuable
  applications in unconventional hydrocarbon recovery and geologic disposal of
  high-level radioactive nuclear waste.
