  This paper focuses on the CO2-EOR in fractured tight oil reservoirs after
  water-flooding treatment. In previous

  works, few studies were presented about the spontaneous imbibition experiments of CO2-rich brine at formation pressure. We

  investigated the influence of CO2 injection on spontaneous imbibition, which is an essential mechanism to improve oil recovery

  in tight reservoir. In this paper, a laboratory equipment was set up to conduct spontaneous imbibition experiments at formation

  temperature of 65 °C and pressures of 10−22 MPa on different low-permeability core samples from Nugget, Kentucky, Colton,

  and Crab-Orchard in the United States. Moreover, we proposed a saturation-based dimensionless time model to scale the

  spontaneous imbibition and a modified Ma model to fit the oil recovery curves of spontaneous imbibition of CO2-rich brine

  with double peaks of imbibition rate. The results of quantitative imbibition experiments confirm that both the oil production

  per unit area and the oil recovery have a positive proportional relationship with permeability. A primary reason is that both the

  capillary pressure and the viscous resistance increase with decreasing of capillary size, but the viscous resistance is more

  sensitive. The result also quantitatively demonstrates that both the oil production and the oil recovery increase with confining

  pressure, especially when the pressure exceeds minimum miscibility pressure. However, the pendent drop test illustrates that

  CO2 decreases the oil−water interfacial tension with the elevating of pressure. CO2 can improve the recovery of tight oil by

  spontaneous imbibition in two main mechanisms: decreasing oil viscosity to improve flowing ability and oil swelling to enhance

  the cocurrent imbibition. This work provides theory basis and feasible measure for CO2-EOR in the fractured and water-flooded

  tight reservoir.
