  Density-driven convection, which can accelerate the

  dissolution rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) in resident brine, is critical for

  the long-term fate of the injected CO2 permanence and security of CO2

  geological storage. Visualization experiments and pressure−volume−

  temperature (PVT) testing were conducted to investigate the influence

  from gravitational convection. For investigate gravitational instabilities and

  convective diffusion, we designed a Hele-Shaw cell rated to 70 MPa and

  Rayleigh number of 346 to conduct visualization experiments with the

  micro-schlieren technique. The average diffusion coefficient and timedependent values were measured in the PVT experiments. We also

  calculated the convection parameters, including Rayleigh number and

  critical onset time, with a series of PVT testing at the temperature ranging

  293.15−423.15 K and pressure ranging 14−24 MPa by using the constant-pressure method. Through visualization experiments,

  we observed convective currents triggered by the density gradient in the gas−liquid interface, which noticeably enhanced the

  CO2 dissolution rate. The PVT testing confirmed that the diffusion coefficient increased sharply under the influence of the

  gravitational convection at the early stage and then decreased toward the average diffusion coefficient with time. The PVT

  testing also demonstrated the Rayleigh number increasing with temperature or pressure increasing under the reservoir

  conditions. The gravitational convection will be more likely to occur and more rapid with a greater pressure or higher

  temperature.
