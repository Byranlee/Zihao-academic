abstract: After waterflooding treatments over several decades, the petrophysical
  properties of the producing reservoir can change in many aspects. Because the
  hydrocarbon potential of certain reservoirs is still promising, it is crucial
  to identify the variation of these petrophysical properties after the
  long-term waterflooding treatments. Therefore, several groups of core samples,
  which came from an old oilfield in the northeastern region of China, were
  collected to investigate the variation in these properties in the reservoir.
  These samples were drilled and extracted from four different types of
  inspection wells and thus can represent the different stages of the reservoir
  during the development history of nearly forty years. A series of tests and
  experiments were conducted on the samples in order to measure properties such
  as porosity, permeability, three types of sensitivity, wettability, and
  internal pore structure. Moreover, the data of experimental results were
  classified and analyzed using statistical methods. The multiple linear
  regression model was applied with the predictors such as porosity and
  sensitivity index. The results showed that certain variables can predict the
  permeability. Furthermore, both the mean values and standard deviations of the
  porosity and permeability increased after the long-term waterflooding
  treatment. The variation of sensitivity, wettability, and pore structure all
  presented significant directionality. Moreover, the CT scanning experiment
  directly showed the forming process of large pore channel. Improved
  understanding of the reservoir properties after long-term-waterflooding
  treatments will provide valuable guidance for the follow-up production design.
