abstract: A new-type plugging coated particle system was investigated which is
  applied in high temperature & salinity reservoir, the temperature up to 300 ℃
  and salinity up to 250,000 mg/L. To analyze these factors, based on adhesion
  feature of the particle, a series of experiments were performed to investigate
  properties of particle and its suspension system, including dynamic plugging
  experiments, etc. The results showed that the particles can adhere together
  under certain temperature up to 140 ℃. Moreover, the particle suspension,
  including HPG system and foam system, were screened based on suspending time.
  In addition, we selected four parameters, including salinity, injection rate,
  permeability and mass fraction, to measure plugging ability of system.
  Meanwhile, the visual microscopic models and glass sand-pack models were
  designed to observe directly particle flow in the porous media. Finally, the
  force analysis of particles at some special locations in the models was
  simulated by COMSOL Multiphysics. Experimental results confirmed the essential
  characters of new-type particle and indicate that this plugging system had
  excellent plugging performance in high temperature & salinity environment. The
  particle migration had strong correlation with permeability and the particle
  had impacted on the original structure of mineral. The process of packing was
  accelerated and repeated. Besides, keeping the particle single and improving
  material strength would promote plugging effects. The evaluation and mechanism
  research of new type plugging particle could provide guidance for plugging
  agent selection in high temperature and field development project designing.
