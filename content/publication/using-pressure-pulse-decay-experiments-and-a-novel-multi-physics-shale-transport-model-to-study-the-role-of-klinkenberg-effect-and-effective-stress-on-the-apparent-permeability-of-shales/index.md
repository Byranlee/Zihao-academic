abstract: The confining pressure imposed on a shale formation has a significant
  impact on the apparent permeability of the rock. Gas flow in low-permeability
  shales differs significantly from liquid flow because of the Klinkenberg
  effect, which results from gas molecule slip at the wall surfaces inside the
  nanopores. This effect causes the increase of apparent permeability (i.e., the
  measured permeability). In this study, cores extracted from four U.S. shale
  formations were tested using a pulse decay permeameter (PDP) under varying
  combinations of confining and pore pressures. The Klinkenberg coefficient was
  calculated to interpret the change in the measured apparent permeability as a
  function of pore pressure and effective stress. Next, based on the various
  combinations of confining and pore pressures, the actual values of the Biot
  coefficient were calculated by data fitting. Moreover, the samples were cored
  in the directions parallel to and perpendicular to the shale bedding planes to
  unravel the role of bedding plane direction on the apparent permeability.
  Furthermore, a novel, multi-physics shale transport (MPST) model was developed
  to account for the coupled multi-physics processes of geomechanics, fluid
  dynamics, and Klinkenberg effect for gas transport in shales. In the MPST
  model, pore pressure and effective stress are the two independent input
  variables, and the measured apparent permeability is the model output. The
  MPST model was then used to fit the PDP experimental data, and the successful
  data fitting confirmed that the MPST model captures the critical multi-physics
  processes that regulate the apparent permeability.
