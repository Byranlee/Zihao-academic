abstract: Cement around geothermal production wells undergoes at least two wellbore repairs throughout its 30-year lifespan. Each repair is generally greater than $1.5 million annually per wellboreâ€”without taking into consideration the economic loss resulting from stopping production. Therefore, the need for next-generation cement materials, such as those with self-healing capabilities, has become more urgent. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has developed fit-for-purpose self-healing cements, the first "Molecular Velcro" technology with the potential ability to self-repair cracks throughout the entire life span of the cement structure. PNNL's patented technology combines select polymers with cement to produce cement that heals itself within 24-72 hours of when cracks occur depending on crack aperture. Our team discovered that blending cement with a small fraction of polymers having the right chemical functionality enables the composite material to reversibly and dynamically bond across fissures to heal damaged areas. When a crack forms, nearby polymer migrates to the crack driven by concentration gradient and capillary forces and form a tight chemical bond to fill the void reinforcing the material's structure. The team has also shown that the cementitious material is about 50% more ductile lowering fracture propagation rates and aiding to more efficient self-healing. These fit-for-purpose cement formulations are designed for ambient and low temperature (up to 120C) applications as well as for extreme temperatures found in geothermal and high-temperature tight oil and gas recovery (150-350C). The results show multiple self-healing ability with recovery of up to 100% in compressive strength, and tensile strength. This presentation will briefly show experimental and modeling results obtained this far on this 2020 R&D100 award winner technology.
