abstract: With the advancement of drilling and completion technologies in
  unconventional reservoirs, more extended reach wells are developed, and
  narrow-fracture environments are created in these reservoirs. Proppant
  embedment in monolayer/thin-layer-propped fractures can be significantly
  different from multilayer-propped fractures. In this study, a comprehensive
  investigation combining laboratory experiments with numerical simulations was
  conducted to explore the factors affecting proppant embedment and induced
  fracture conductivity loss in narrow fractures. The fracture-conductivity
  experiments were performed using monolayers of sand and ceramic proppant
  particles sandwiched between Berea Sandstone and Eagle Ford Shale plates under
  different closure pressures. The experiment study demonstrated that the
  long-term rock/fluid interaction leads to significant proppant embedment, and
  the fracture having a rough rock surface has higher fracture conductivity in
  monolayer-propped fractures. To further quantify the influence of proppant
  layer number, size, distribution variations, and particle crushing on proppant
  embedment, a numerical modeling approach that coupled continuum mechanics,
  discrete element method (DEM), and the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method was
  developed. In the simulation, the fracture/proppant system was constructed by
  filling proppant, modeled by DEM, between two fracture surfaces that were
  modeled by FLAC3D (Itasca Consulting Group 2012); LB simulation was then
  performed on the changing proppant pack to compute its time-dependent
  permeability. The numerical model was validated by comparing numerical results
  with measured fracture conductivities in the laboratory experiment. The
  simulation results demonstrated a strong correlation between proppant
  embedment and rock mechanical properties. When the Young’s modulus of the rock
  plate is less than 5 GPa, large magnitudes of proppant embedment can be
  expected in fractures supported by monolayers of ceramic proppant particles.
  Moreover, large-size proppant particles are more sensitive to the variations
  of Young’s modulus of the rock plate. When the rock formation in a narrow
  fracture environment has a relatively high Young’s modulus, the proppant
  diameter distribution has a lesser effect on the fracture conductivity. The
  outcome of this study will provide insights into the role of reservoir rock
  characteristics, proppant properties, and closure pressure on proppant
  embedment in narrow fractures.
