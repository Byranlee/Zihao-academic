abstract: "Hydraulic fracturing is an influential revolution in the global
  energy industry. One of the critical properties in hydraulic fracturing is the
  fracture conductivity, which measures the capability of a fracture to transmit
  fluids, and can be calculated as the product of fracture permeability and
  width. Fractures created in hydraulic fracturing usually have rough rock
  surfaces due to the influences of natural fractures and/or bedding planes.
  However, most existing laboratory works on fracture conductivity depended on
  using fractures between flat rock slabs that led to smooth fracture contact
  surfaces. In this research, we made fracture conductivity measurements in the
  laboratory using non-smooth-surface shale slabs. We also conducted numerical
  studies using a discrete element method/Lattice Boltzmann (DEM/LB) coupled
  model. We found the fracture conductivity values with ceramic proppant (2
  lb/ft2) placed in the fracture space were about 3-8 times higher than those
  without proppant placement. For the fractures having proppant placement, the
  gas-measured fracture conductivity values were higher than the water-measured
  ones due to the Klinkenberg effect. Moreover, the decrease of fracture
  conductivity with increasing closure pressure was not noticeable when there
  was no proppant placed in the fracture space. Our experimental results
  demonstrated that it was preferable to have proppant placed in the fractures,
  even though the rock surface roughness provided some fracture conductivity via
  the “self-propping” mechanism. Besides, the effect of solid/liquid
  interactions, such as rock surface softening, cannot be simply neglected when
  the shale slabs were in contact with the injection liquid, which caused clay
  swelling in shale and proppant embedment into rock surfaces. The DEM/LB
  coupled numerical model was able to measure fracture conductivity as a
  function of closure pressure for both proppant-supported and “self-propping”
  fractures.   "
