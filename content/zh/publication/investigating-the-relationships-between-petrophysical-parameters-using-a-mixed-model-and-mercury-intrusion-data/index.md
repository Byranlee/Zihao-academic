abstract: A mercury intrusion experiment is one of the most important methods to
  investigate pore structure of core samples by measuring petrophysical
  parameters, such as the sorting coefficient and mean pore radius, etc. These
  petrophysical parameters describe the pore structure, which has a strong
  relationship with porosity and permeability. However there is no universal
  mathematical relationship between them so far. With a better understanding of
  such a relationship, reservoir simulators can be built more accurately. Since
  the oilfields' development decades ago, mercury intrusion data have been
  collected from a variety of geological settings and the different geological
  characteristics often have substantial impacts on the relationship between the
  petrophysical parameters. Therefore, we aim to develop a statistical model
  that not only captures this relationship but also accounts for different
  geological backgrounds. Data containing more than thirty development blocks
  were collected and classified. Based on these data, a mixed model was
  developed to describe this hierarchical behavior. An overall connection
  between the petrophysical parameters is treated as the fixed effect at a
  higher level, whereas some small variations due to the geological background
  are accounted for as the random effect at a lower level. Although all
  petrophysical parameters are considered in the model as either the fixed or
  random effect at the beginning, each one is tested for its significance. If
  results show that the random effect is insignificant, then this parameter has
  no noticeable difference across different geologic settings. If the fixed
  effect is insignificant, then this parameter has no critical impact on the
  relationship. Because a statistical model is built, the results are shown
  probabilistically. Essential visualizations are presented to help understand
  and interpret the results. Variable selection and hypothesis testing are
  performed to develop the most desirable model. A final best model is achieved
  to explain the relationship based on different geological behaviors, and this
  model can be used for prediction in different geological settings. With the
  studied relationship and advanced model, reservoir simulators can be greatly
  refined and improved in the future.
